# Ideas for data storytelling

I am looking primarily at two main possibilities for data storytelling, both linked to quantitative financial approaches. 

The first, which would be more standard, would be an exploration of the unusually low volatility that has pervaded our market environment recently. This would be relatively easy to do: most of the relevant data is available through the quandl API and the Federal Reserve's releases. Natural thing would be to study the relationship between volatility of bond prices and volatility of the S&P, or certain subsectors of the S&P, or perhaps the relationship to the prices of gold and cryptocurencies.  


The second is considerably more involved. It would involve scraping websites that display inventory, and analyzing inventory to get a sense of a company's turnover and therefore revenue. There are many possibilities here: Tesla, avnet or arrow for semiconductor parts, home builder inventories, etc. We could use that to predict either company performance or to find an internal story for how the data is evolving. 

Tesla is a nice example in the latter case, you could correlate Tesla inventory turnover with Musk tweets.
